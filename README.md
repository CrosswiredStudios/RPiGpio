# RPiGpio C#
A collection of useful classes for using various sensors with the raspberry pi and a UWP app

I was doing a lot of work on some personal projects and thought that some people out there would enjoy some of the code. These classes are all written in c# and may include other dependencies.

Most devices have a basic set of function and Observables for any information you want to receive. Have fun!

Supported Devices:

   Relay
   MFRC522
